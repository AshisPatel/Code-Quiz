# Code Quiz - Week 4 Challenge

## Purpose 

![Taking the code quiz and viewing the functionality of each button](https://github.com/AshisPatel/Code-Quiz-Week-4-Challenge/blob/main/assets/images/Code-Quiz-Preview.gif)

The code quiz is a minute-long four question quiz! The purpose of this quiz was to demonstrate that webpages can be updated dynamically thorugh utilizing the DOM and Jscript. A static HTML framework can become much more animated with scripts running behind the scenes. Through jscript we can change existing HTML elements and even create new ones. Truly, using javascript can lead to quite the *dynamic* experience. 


**SN:** A big thank you to the UTA bootcamp for providing questions & answers for the assignment.

## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my code quiz and README! In this weeks challenge, I attempted a dizzying amount of dynamic generation and then realized I needed to tune it back some. After some drafting of algorithims (and discussion with various individuals about the ups and downs to static vs dynamic HTML), I arrived at the happy balance that is my project. Please enjoy the following fun fact and a gif from my collection of things that makes me laugh! Hopefully, they provide you with some amusement and something random to show to a friend!

**Fun Fact**: Back in 16th century Constantinople, not providing enough coffee to your wife was grounds for divorce!
