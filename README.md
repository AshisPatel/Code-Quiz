# Code Quiz - Week 4 Challenge

## Purpose 

![Taking the code quiz and viewing the functionality of each button](https://github.com/AshisPatel/Code-Quiz-Week-4-Challenge/blob/main/assets/images/Code-Quiz-Preview.gif)

The code quiz is a minute-long four question quiz! The purpose of the quiz is to demonstrate that a static HTML page can be made more animated through Jscript and the DOM. Truly, using Jscript can lead to quite the *dynamic* experience. Bad puns aside, the quiz is based on a timer and point-deduction or accumulation from answering the questions right or wrong. The participant starts off with a total of 60 points (seconds) and each wrong question removes 10 points (and seconds from the timer). However, answering a question right also nets the user an additional 10 points. Due to a lack of question & answer randomization one may be able to achieve a score of 99! 

# Function 

Functionally, the quiz page works by having four static HTML sections that are either made visible or hidden. The visibility relies on swapping classes in the script using specific event listeners and handlers. The remainder of the quiz's functions are also performed using Jscript, such as storing and sorting the highscores, determining correct & wrong answers, and so on. 

**SN:** A big thank you to the UTA bootcamp for providing questions & answers for the assignment.

## End Note - A Thank You to the Reader 

Thank you for taking the time to check out my code quiz and README! In this weeks challenge, I attempted a dizzying amount of dynamic generation and then realized I needed to tune it back some. After some drafting of algorithms (and discussion with various individuals about the ups and downs to static vs dynamic HTML), I arrived at the happy balance that is my project. Please enjoy the following fun fact and a gif from my collection of things that makes me laugh! Hopefully, they provide you with some amusement and something random to show to a friend!
